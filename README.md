# Amazon UI Automation Framework

This is a simple test automation framework built to demonstrate my understanding of BDD using Java, Selenium WebDriver, TestNG, and Cucumber.

It's based on similar frameworks Iâ€™ve worked with in previous client projects, and I created this version to use as a public example for job interviews and portfolio purposes.

## Technologies used

- Java
- Selenium WebDriver
- Cucumber (BDD)
- TestNG
- Maven
- ExtentReports
- Page Object Model

## Scenario

The test scenario automates the process of searching for a product on Amazon and adding it to the cart. Here's a summary of the steps:

- Open the Amazon homepage
- Accept cookies
- Search for a product
- Apply filters (Shipped by Amazon, Brand: Apple)
- Select the first product from results
- Add it to the cart
- Check the shopping cart

This scenario is written using Gherkin language inside a `.feature` file.

## Project structure

- `DriverFactory.java`: Initializes and manages WebDriver
- `Hooks.java`: Sets up and tears down the test environment
- `ConfigReader.java`: Loads configuration properties
- `Pages/`: Contains page object classes
- `StepDefinitions/`: Contains the step definitions linked to the feature file
- `Features/`: Stores the `.feature` file written in Gherkin
- `ExtentReport.html`: Automatically generated after each test run
